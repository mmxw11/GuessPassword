# GuessPassword
A Fun project made for school. 
You must try guess the right password for each user.
This uses client side js password validation so it's an awful idea to use it for anything serious.
Some elements are written in <b>Finnish</b>.

To change passwords go to loginscripts.js

Default credentials:

| User          | Password                      | 
| ------------- |:----------------------------: |
| User 1        | test1                         |
| User 2        | test2                         |
| User 3        | test3                         |
| User 4        | test4                         |
| User 5        | test5  (md5 encryption used)  |
